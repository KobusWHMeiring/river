# UI/UX Standards

## Aesthetic Principles
- **Clean & Professional:** Avoid overly flashy animations or "playful" elements that detract from utility.
- **High Information Density:** Users should be able to see as much relevant data as possible (e.g., 4 visits per page in reports).
- **Subtle Styling:** Use thin borders and muted colors. Avoid jarring, high-contrast colors unless for critical warnings.
- **Consistency:** Use consistent spacing (margins/padding) and font sizes throughout the application.

## Interaction Patterns
- **Modals:** Use for quick actions (like adding a task) to maintain context on the main page.
- **Form Feedback:** Provide immediate feedback for actions (e.g., auto-populating instructions from templates).
- **Native Experience:** Prefer native browser behaviors where they provide the best performance and accessibility.

## Color Palette
- **Primary:** Professional blues or grays.
- **Secondary:** Muted tones for background sections (Zones).
- **Warnings/Errors:** Use standard red/yellow but sparingly.
