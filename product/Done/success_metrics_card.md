# PRD: Clarify Success Metrics Card

## 1. Problem Statement
The "Success Metrics" card on the dashboard currently displays "100%" with the label "All section data validated". This is unclear and misleading - users don't understand what this metric means or how it's calculated. It provides no actionable insight.

## 2. Strategic Goal
To replace the vague "Success Metrics" card with meaningful, understandable metrics that actually help managers assess project health and progress.

## 3. Proposed Scope
- **Define Clear Metrics:** Identify 2-3 meaningful success indicators
- **Update Display:** Replace the card content with actionable metrics
- **Context:** Ensure metrics are self-explanatory

## 4. Technical Constraints
- Metrics should be derivable from existing data (Tasks, VisitLogs, Sections)
- Should not require new data collection
- Must remain performant (no complex queries)

# User Stories (Generated by Technical PO)

## Story 1: Define Success Metrics
**Value Proposition:** As a Manager, I want to understand what "success" means in the context of this project, so that I can track meaningful progress.

**Technical Implementation Path:**
- Target File: `core/views.py` (`GlobalDashboardView`)
  - Calculate meaningful metrics:
    - **Task Completion Rate:** (completed tasks / total tasks) * 100
    - **Sections with Recent Activity:** Count of sections with VisitLog in last 30 days
    - **Average Tasks per Week:** Tracking engagement over time
- Target File: `core/templates/core/dashboard.html`
  - Update the Success Metrics card with new metrics

**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- [ ] Card displays 2-3 clear metrics with labels
- [ ] Each metric has a brief explanation/tooltip
- [ ] Metrics are calculated correctly from database

**The Test Plan (MANDATORY):**
- **Unit Test:** Create tasks with various completion statuses. Verify completion rate calculates correctly.

## Story 2: Make Metrics Actionable
**Value Proposition:** As a Manager, I want to see metrics that help me identify areas needing attention, so that I can take corrective action.

**Technical Implementation Path:**
- Target File: `core/views.py`
  - Add drill-down capability: clicking a metric could filter to relevant items
  - Consider: "Sections needing attention" (no activity in 30+ days)
- Target File: `core/templates/core/dashboard.html`
  - Make metrics clickable or add "View Details" links

**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- [ ] Users can click on a metric to see related items
- [ ] Low-performing areas are highlighted

**The Test Plan (MANDATORY):**
- **Integration Test:** Click on "Sections with recent activity" - verify it shows the relevant sections.

## Story 3: Remove Vague Display
**Value Proposition:** As a User, I want clear information, not confusing placeholders.

**Technical Implementation Path:**
- Target File: `core/templates/core/dashboard.html`
  - Remove the hardcoded "100%" and "All section data validated"
  - Replace with dynamic, meaningful content

**Acceptance Criteria (AC):**
- [ ] No misleading "100%" placeholder
- [ ] Card title and content are aligned

**The Test Plan (MANDATORY):**
- **Visual Test:** Load dashboard, verify Success Metrics card shows real data.

**CRITICAL STOP RULE:**
Which metrics should we display? Options:
1. Task Completion Rate (simple, actionable)
2. Sections Active in Last 30 Days (engagement metric)
3. Average Visits per Section (distribution)
4. Photos Uploaded (engagement)

**Decision:** Start with Task Completion Rate + Sections Active (30 days) - these are most actionable.
